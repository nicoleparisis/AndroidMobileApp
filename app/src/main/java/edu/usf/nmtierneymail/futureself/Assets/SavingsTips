        "text":"If you are someone who loves to have the latest styles and brands, just because you want to save money doesn’t mean that you are doomed to outdated and decade-old clothing.  But, you do have to think a little outside the box in order to make both work.  Sites like Rue La La send you daily emails with huge discounts on the hottest brands.  They are free to use and can save you up to 80% off of retail."

        "title":"Buy Jewelry From A Discounter",
        "text":"If you haven’t purchased jewelry in a while, you may be interested to know that the jewelry industry is going through some major changes. Diamonds have always had ridiculous markups, but recently there are more options for relief. Many direct importers are selling rings themselves at much better prices than you could get from the traditional stores. It makes perfect sense – the traditional stores have to pay for a storefront, sales force, utilities, etc., therefore the importers can usually beat their prices hands down."

        "title":"Simplify Your Wardrobe",
        "text":"Don’t buy clothes that will only work as one outfit. Look for clothes that you will be able to wear with many other things, creating multiple outfits. Instead of buying that green and purple striped coat that will only go with one or two outfits, you could get a solid color gray that will work with most of what you wear. Spend less money on the trendy items that won’t be in style long, and spend more on quality items. You really can do this and still be stylish at the same time"

        "text":"It is easier than you may think. eBay and Amazon.com make the process a breeze. Sign up for an account, take a few digital pictures, post it, and watch the buyers come to you. HINT: The biggest key I have noticed is selling brand name items and taking a few seconds to think, “If I wanted to buy this item, how would I search for it?” If you do this, you will be much more successful."

        "text":"You can save a lot of money on car depreciation by purchasing a car at least 2 years old. Some cars can lose as much as 35% in value during the first year. It’s best to drive a car as long as you can, especially if you do purchase them new."

        "title":"Don't buy bottled water",
        "text":"Bottled water is undeniably a luxury in a country where nearly everyone has drinkable tap water. The real expense in this area, though, isn't buying cases of water and bringing them home. What breaks many budgets is the habitual buying of water at restaurants and convenience stores, and even movie theaters or sporting events. In those scenarios, a single bottle can cost anywhere from $2 to double or even triple that."

        "title":"Trade your latte for coffee",
        "text":"While making coffee at home by the pot saves the most money, it also involves a bit of hassle, and perhaps you enjoy the experience of visiting a coffee house as much as the coffee itself. But if you substitute a $5 latte for a $2 cup of coffee five days a week, you'll save $780 a year. If you're a seven-day-a week coffee buyer, you'll save $1,092."

        "text":"While many people already have cost-efficient smartphone plans for their immediate families, it's possible to save even more by bundling your savings with relatives who are a little farther afield. The deals vary, but low-cost carriers Sprint and T-Mobile have at various times offered a free third or fourth line. In addition, both of those companies have plans in which additional lines (up to a limit) cost less."
